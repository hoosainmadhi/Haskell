{-
Really, the main difference between the two is that let expressions
are . . . well . . . expressions, whereas where bindings arenâ€™t. If something is
an expression, then it has a value. "boo!" is an expression, as are 3 + 5 and
head [1,2,3] . This means that you can use let expressions almost anywhere
in your code, like this:
ghci> 4 * (let a = 9 in a + 1) + 2
42
